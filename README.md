In C, you can implement stack and queue data structures using arrays or linked lists. Here are the basic operations for both stack and queue:

Stack Operations:

Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.

c
Copy code
void push(int stack[], int *top, int element) {
    stack[++(*top)] = element;
}
Pop: Removes and returns the topmost element from the stack.

c
Copy code
int pop(int stack[], int *top) {
    return stack[(*top)--];
}
Peek: Returns the value of the topmost element without removing it.

c
Copy code
int peek(int stack[], int top) {
    return stack[top];
}
Queue Operations:

Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear/end of the queue.

c
Copy code
void enqueue(int queue[], int *rear, int element) {
    queue[++(*rear)] = element;
}
Dequeue: Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.

c
Copy code
int dequeue(int queue[], int *front) {
    return queue[(*front)++];
}
Front: Returns the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

c
Copy code
int front(int queue[], int front) {
    return queue[front];
}
Note: These implementations assume that the stack and queue are implemented using arrays and that appropriate error handling (such as checking for empty stack/queue conditions) is performed as needed.

Alternatively, you can also implement stacks and queues using linked lists, which involve dynamically allocating memory for each node. The operations would be similar but with different implementation details.
